He is a member of the new period instrument ensemble Gut Reaction and has been a featured guest with the Chameleon Arts Ensemble of Boston, the Daedalus Quartet, the Northwest Sinfonietta, Pacific Baroque Orchestra, Philharmonia Northwest, and the Portland Baroque Orchestra. He also appears frequently in recital with violinist Ingrid Matthews, with whom he co-founded the Seattle Baroque Orchestra in 1994.

He is also a member of the newly founded bi-coastal baroque ensemble, Gut Reaction.

Fisher has performed with members of the Florestan and Peabody Trios, and the Brentano, Cleveland, Emerson, Mendelssohn, and St. Lawrence String Quartets. In an appearance with the Peabody Trio, he was hailed as a “fine guest artist”, his performance described as “first-rate” (The Baltimore Sun). He was both a Carnegie Hall Fellow, taking him on a tour of concerts, outreach, and cultural exchange in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as a Peabody Singapore Fellow, spending a month in Southeast Asia assisting with inaugural ceremonies for the new Yong Siew Toh Conservatory and performing as guest with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra.
